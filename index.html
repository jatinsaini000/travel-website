<h5>Triund Hill</h5>

<p>Grade: Moderate Mcleodganj to Triund 2800 mtrs, 9 kms gradual trek. The trek offer panoramic views Bhagsu village, Mcleodganj, Dharamsala valley and distant views of Shivalik hills and plains of Kangra valley. The trek is moderate nature. Triund is a large land of green grass and pasture like. One can see the mighty Dhauladhar ranges just above the eyes. This is the base camp and climatization point for trekkers climbing the Inderahara point in the Mt. Dhauladhar.</p>

<h5>Mullayanagiri</h5>
<p>A must visit place, if you are planning for Chickmagalore. Highest peak in Karnataka, India. We visited on 7th August 2023. Scenic location. Adventures drive to the nearest motorable road. Approximately 500 steps to climb up to the peak. You can feel the cloud touching you. Google map shows wrong direction if you search with just “ Mullayangiri Peak” I suggest to search in google maps with location address as: “Mullayyanagiri Peak Car Parking”</p>

<h5>Dainkund Peak</h5>
<p>Daikund to Jot trek, must do for all. I planned this for my family (me, wife, and 12 yr old kid) Walk is easy, our guide Mr Rasheed was very helpful and you can contact him at 096250 32916 if you need a guide for this trek. We started early at 6am (in April) and would suggest the same to all, maybe start at 5am itself and enjoy the sunrise as well.</p>
